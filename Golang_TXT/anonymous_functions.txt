Anonymous functions have a number of features which make them useful. They can be executed at the same time that they're declared - this is what the () at the end of the anonymous function is doing. Secondly, they maintain access to the lexical scope they are defined in - all the variables that are available at the point when you declare the anonymous function are also available in the body of the function.


func () {
    doStuff()
}()
